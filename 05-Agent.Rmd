# Week 5: Spatial and Agent-Based Models

- Mon: From compartmental to spatial models; landscape-level processes
- Tue: 2D grid modeling in R (e.g., forest fire spread, invasive plant species)
- Wed: Group work: design a spatial model for habitat fragmentation
- Thu: Peer Review Studio: Exchange and critique spatial model prototypes
- Fri: Explore NetLogo or agent-based modeling for seed dispersal or species movement** Explore NetLogo or agent-based modeling for seed dispersal or species movement
