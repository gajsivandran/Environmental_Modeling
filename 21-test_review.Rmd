# Test Review Material

## Instructions
Below are the general instructions for all tests

- You will get a chance to **retake** this. Your **highest** score counts toward your final grade.  
- Follow the guidance for each part and **show all work** for full credit.  
- **Non-graphical calculators** are allowed.  
- **One page (two sides)** of handwritten (or font size 8) notes are allowed.
- The equation sheet from the textbook is included as part of the test pack (it doesn't count as note pages)


## Practice Test 1
### Spring 2025
**Short-Answer Questions (20 points)**

1. **(4 pts)** Explain how to test if a **limit** exists at a point on a function.

2. **(4 pts)** What is the difference between **secant** and **tangent** lines?  
   Explain using a **sketch** and how they relate to **rates of change**.

3. **(4 pts)** Identify a scenario where a function has a **sharp corner or cusp** and explain why the **derivative does not exist** there.  
   Include **sketches**.

4. **(4 pts)** What do the points where \(f'(x)=0\) represent on the graph of \(f(x)\)?  
   Include a **sketch** in your answer.

5. **(4 pts)** List the **conditions required** for a function to be **differentiable** at a point.  
   How do you test for these **two conditions**?

**Problems (30 points)**

### Problem 1

Let \( f(x)=10x^{2}+e^{x} \).

1. **(3 pts)** Find the **average velocity** on the interval \([2,6]\).  
2. **(3 pts)** **Estimate**, using the **limit definition** of the derivative, the **instantaneous velocity** at \(x=4\).

---

### Problem 2

Using the **limit definition** of the derivative, let \( f(x)=x^{2}-4x \).

1. **(3 pts)** Find an expression for \(f'(x)\).  
2. **(2 pts)** Find the derivative at \(x=3\).  
3. **(3 pts)** Find the **equation of the tangent line** at \(x=3\).  
4. **(2 pts)** Using \(f'(x)\), determine where the **rate of change** of \(f(x)\) is **zero**.  
5. **(2 pts)** Explain how you would **adapt the limit definition** of a **first derivative** to find the **second derivative**.  
   *(Do not actually compute \(f''(x)\).)*  
6. **(2 pts)** In words, what does the **second derivative** mean?
