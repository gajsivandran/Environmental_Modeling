# Prob Workbook

## Learning Goals
By the end of this in-class session, you will be able to:

1. Interpret and compare **PDFs** and **CDFs** for environmental variables.  
2. Choose reasonable probability models (Normal, Lognormal, Gamma, Exponential, Weibull, Poisson, Gumbel) for a given process.  
3. Estimate simple distribution parameters from data (quick **method-of-moments**).  

## Run the Tree Height Demo App

::: promptbox
**Background**
The data in this file is from a large sampling of an established forest. 500 tree heights were surveyed.

In the overview tab you are given some information on the data.
In your own words describe what the following mean to you

- mean
- standard deviation (variance)
- mode (can you determine where it is?)
- median (can you determine where it is?)

**Class Discussion**

- How is the kind of data used?
- What kinds of insights can we extract?
- How could we use this in modeling?

::: promptbox
**PDFs** *the math kind*

Observe the bar graph of probabilities. 

- How does it compare to the histogram on the previous tab?
- What's the same / different?
- There are two fitted curves (distributions) to the data, one is *normal* the other *empirical* - what do you think the difference is?
- Which of the fitted distributions do you think is right?


Set the lower and upper bound to 24

- What probability do you get for the empirical and theoretical distributions?

Set the lower bound to 17 and upper bound to 23

- What probability do you get for the empirical and theoretical distributions?

Can you explain how the probability is calculated?

::: promptbox
**CDFs**

Cumulative distributions functions are the accumulation of the pdf curve. Or in mathematical language, the integration of the PDF.

Lets see what you remember from calc

- The point of inflection on the CDF correspons to what on the pdf (its derivative)

- Examine the slopes of the CDF, describe what is happening from 10 to 30 (in everyday words)


Now repeat what we did earlier, set the lower and upper bound to 24

- What probability do you get for the empirical and theoretical distributions?

Set the lower bound to 17 and upper bound to 23

- What probability do you get for the empirical and theoretical distributions?

Can you explain how the probability is calculated?

**Sampling from a CDF**

**How Sampling from a CDF Works**

The **Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)** tells us, for any value \(x\), the probability that a random variable is *less than or equal* to that value ‚Äî  
\[
F(x) = P(X \le x)
\]

If we reverse this process, we can **generate new samples** that follow the same distribution as the data.  
Here‚Äôs the logic:

1. Draw a random number \(u\) between 0 and 1 ‚Äî this represents a cumulative probability.  
2. Find the value \(x\) where \(F(x) = u\).  
3. That value \(x\) becomes one of your simulated samples.  

In other words, each \(u\) tells you *how far up the CDF to go*, and you then read off the corresponding \(x\)-value on the horizontal axis.  
Doing this repeatedly produces data that follow the same shape and probabilities as your original dataset.

---

**Try It Yourself**

- Click **‚ÄúDraw 1 sample‚Äù** to see how a random \(u\) maps to a tree height \(x\) on the CDF.  
- Draw **10 samples at a time** to see how your histogram begins to approximate the original data.  
- Watch the **Running KDE (samples)** curve below ‚Äî does it begin to match the **Empirical KDE (full data)** or the **Normal(Œº,œÉ) fit**?  
- Reflect: *Why does the sample-based distribution become smoother and more similar as the number of samples increases?*  
  *(Hint: the Law of Large Numbers.)*

### Step 3: Raw data exploration - Daily{-}

Save the sea_tac.R file to your **Models** folder

Be sure the place the dataset seatac_data.csv in a folder titled **data** (which should be inside your Models folder) 

In the **Daily Time Series Tab**

- Any outliers? are they real? or are they errors?
- Do the values make sense?
- Observe any trends

Go back to the Daily Time Series Tab
Set the dates from 2024-10-15 to 2025-10-15

- In a small group, think about how you would create an synthetic timeseries of rainfall.
- How could you use the dataset we downloaded?
- What statistics could we utilize?
- Any ideas on how we could use probabilities to build a timeseries?

#### 1. Explore Annual Distribution Fits{-}
Open **Annual Data ‚Üí Distribution of annual totals.**

1. Select all the distribution fits.
2. Observe how each distribution curve matches (or misses) the histogram.

::: promptbox

**Prompt 5:** 

- Which distribution best captures the shape of the annual rainfall data?  
- What feature (e.g., skewness, tail behavior) informs your choice?

**Prompt 6:**  

- Inspect the **Fit parameters** panel.  
- How do the estimated mean and standard deviation compare across models?

#### 2. Interpret the CDF {-}

- Look at the **CDF** plot (right side).  
- Notice how the **10% and 90%** lines highlight extreme dry or wet years.

::: promptbox

**Prompt 7:**  

- For the each fit, estimate the rainfall amount that marks the 10th and 90th percentile.  
- What do these regions represent?

:::

---

#### 3. Move to Daily Distributions{-}
Explore the **Daily Data** tabs:

- **Volume:** rainfall on wet days  
- **Duration:** consecutive wet days  
- **Interstorm:** consecutive dry days

::: promptbox

**Prompt 8:** 

- Compare the typical shapes of these three distributions.  
- Which one is most skewed?

### Simulation and Model Evaluation{-}

#### 1. Simulate a Single Year{-}
Go to **Simulation ‚Üí Procedure**.

Click **Sample Step** several times and observe how the model builds a time series:

- First sampling **dry days (interstorm)**,
- Then **wet-spell duration**,
- Then **rain volumes**.

::: promptbox

**Prompt 9:** 

- How realistic does the simulated pattern look compared to the actual daily record?  
- Are wet and dry spells too frequent, too long, or about right?

**Prompt 10:**  

- After clicking **Complete 1-Year Simulation**, check the summary panel.  
- How does the total simulated rainfall compare to the historical mean?
- Reset and run again - do things stay the same? are the different?

#### 2. Compare Distributions{-}
Scroll to **Sampled vs. Historical Distributions.**  
Look at how the simulated (red line) distributions compare with historical histograms.

::: promptbox

**Prompt 11:**

what challenges would you expect?

:::

---

### Optional Extensions (for advanced exploration){-}

1. **Parameter Sensitivity:**  
   Adjust the Gamma parameters manually (in R) to see how changing shape/rate alters rainfall variability.

2. **Spatial Extension:**  
   Imagine repeating this analysis for multiple stations across the Pacific Northwest.  
   How might you assess *regional coherence* in rainfall trends?

3. **Climate Change Scenario:**  
   Suppose the mean annual precipitation increases by 10%.  
   How would that shift the fitted distributions and simulated outcomes?

---

### Wrap-Up Reflection{-}

Write a short (1-page) reflection answering:

- Which part of the rainfall record is most predictable, and which is most stochastic?  
- What does this modeling exercise reveal about the relationship between *data* and *simulation*?  
- How could similar probabilistic modeling approaches help in environmental forecasting (e.g., streamflow, drought risk)?
