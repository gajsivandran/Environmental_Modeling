# Prob Workbook

## Learning Goals
By the end of this in-class session, you will be able to:

1. Interpret and compare **PDFs** and **CDFs** for environmental variables.  
2. Choose reasonable probability models (Normal, Lognormal, Gamma, Exponential, Weibull, Poisson, Gumbel) for a given process.  
3. Estimate simple distribution parameters from data (quick **method-of-moments**).  

## Run the Tree Height Demo App

**Background**
The data in this file is from a large sampling of an established forest. 500 tree heights were surveyed.

In the overview tab you are given some information on the data.
In your own words describe what the following mean to you

- mean
- standard deviation (variance)
- mode (can you determine where it is?)
- median (can you determine where it is?)

**Class Discussion**

- How is the kind of data used?
- What kinds of insights can we extract?
- How could we use this in modeling?

**PDFs** *the math kind*

Observe the bar graph of probabilities. 

- How does it compare to the histogram on the previous tab?
- What's the same / different?
- There are two fitted curves (distributions) to the data, one is *normal* the other *empirical* - what do you think the difference is?
- Which of the fitted distributions do you think is right?


Set the lower and upper bound to 24

- What probability do you get for the empirical and theoretical distributions?

Set the lower bound to 17 and upper bound to 23

- What probability do you get for the empirical and theoretical distributions?

Can you explain how the probability is calculated?

**CDFs**

Cumulative distributions functions are the accumulation of the pdf curve. Or in mathematical language, the integration of the PDF.

Lets see what you remember from calc

- The point of inflection on the CDF correspons to what on the pdf (its derivative)

- Examine the slopes of the CDF, describe what is happening from 10 to 30 (in everyday words)


Now repeat what we did earlier, set the lower and upper bound to 24

- What probability do you get for the empirical and theoretical distributions?

Set the lower bound to 17 and upper bound to 23

- What probability do you get for the empirical and theoretical distributions?

Can you explain how the probability is calculated?

**Sampling from a CDF**

**How Sampling from a CDF Works**

The **Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)** tells us, for any value \(x\), the probability that a random variable is *less than or equal* to that value —  
\[
F(x) = P(X \le x)
\]

If we reverse this process, we can **generate new samples** that follow the same distribution as the data.  
Here’s the logic:

1. Draw a random number \(u\) between 0 and 1 — this represents a cumulative probability.  
2. Find the value \(x\) where \(F(x) = u\).  
3. That value \(x\) becomes one of your simulated samples.  

In other words, each \(u\) tells you *how far up the CDF to go*, and you then read off the corresponding \(x\)-value on the horizontal axis.  
Doing this repeatedly produces data that follow the same shape and probabilities as your original dataset.

**Try It Yourself**

- Click **“Draw 1 sample”** to see how a random \(u\) maps to a tree height \(x\) on the CDF.  
- Draw **10 samples at a time** to see how your histogram begins to approximate the original data.  
- Watch the **Running KDE (samples)** curve below — does it begin to match the **Empirical KDE (full data)** or the **Normal(μ,σ) fit**?  
- Reflect: *Why does the sample-based distribution become smoother and more similar as the number of samples increases?*  
  *(Hint: the Law of Large Numbers.)*
