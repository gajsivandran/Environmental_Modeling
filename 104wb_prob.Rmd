# Prob Workbook

## Learning Goals
By the end of this in-class session, you will be able to:

1. Interpret and compare **PDFs** and **CDFs** for environmental variables.  
2. Choose reasonable probability models (Normal, Lognormal, Gamma, Exponential, Weibull, Poisson, Gumbel) for a given process.  
3. Estimate simple distribution parameters from data (quick **method-of-moments**).  

## Run the Tree Height Demo App

**Background**
The data in this file is from a large sampling of an established forest. 500 tree heights were surveyed.

In the overview tab you are given some information on the data.
In your own words describe what the following mean to you

- mean
- standard deviation (variance)
- mode (can you determine where it is?)
- median (can you determine where it is?)

**Class Discussion**

- How is the kind of data used?
- What kinds of insights can we extract?
- How could we use this in modeling?

**PDFs** *the math kind*

Observe the bar graph of probabilities. 

- How does it compare to the histogram on the previous tab?
- What's the same / different?
- There are two fitted curves (distributions) to the data, one is *normal* the other *empirical* - what do you think the difference is?
- Which of the fitted distributions do you think is right?


Set the lower and upper bound to 24

- What probability do you get for the empirical and theoretical distributions?

Set the lower bound to 17 and upper bound to 23

- What probability do you get for the empirical and theoretical distributions?

Can you explain how the probability is calculated?

**CDFs**

Cumulative distributions functions are the accumulation of the pdf curve. Or in mathematical language, the integration of the PDF.

Lets see what you remember from calc

- The point of inflection on the CDF correspons to what on the pdf (its derivative)

- Examine the slopes of the CDF, describe what is happening from 10 to 30 (in everyday words)


Now repeat what we did earlier, set the lower and upper bound to 24

- What probability do you get for the empirical and theoretical distributions?

Set the lower bound to 17 and upper bound to 23

- What probability do you get for the empirical and theoretical distributions?

Can you explain how the probability is calculated?

**Sampling from a CDF**

**How Sampling from a CDF Works**

The **Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF)** tells us, for any value \(x\), the probability that a random variable is *less than or equal* to that value —  
\[
F(x) = P(X \le x)
\]

If we reverse this process, we can **generate new samples** that follow the same distribution as the data.  
Here’s the logic:

1. Draw a random number \(u\) between 0 and 1 — this represents a cumulative probability.  
2. Find the value \(x\) where \(F(x) = u\).  
3. That value \(x\) becomes one of your simulated samples.  

In other words, each \(u\) tells you *how far up the CDF to go*, and you then read off the corresponding \(x\)-value on the horizontal axis.  
Doing this repeatedly produces data that follow the same shape and probabilities as your original dataset.

---

**Try It Yourself**

- Click **“Draw 1 sample”** to see how a random \(u\) maps to a tree height \(x\) on the CDF.  
- Draw **10 samples at a time** to see how your histogram begins to approximate the original data.  
- Watch the **Running KDE (samples)** curve below — does it begin to match the **Empirical KDE (full data)** or the **Normal(μ,σ) fit**?  
- Reflect: *Why does the sample-based distribution become smoother and more similar as the number of samples increases?*  
  *(Hint: the Law of Large Numbers.)*

## Lab 3: Exploring NOAA Climate Data

In this activity, you will work with real-world climate data from the **National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI)**.

::: promptbox
### Step 1: Download Data {-}
1. Go to the [NOAA Climate Data Online (CDO)](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web/).
2. Under **"Data Tools"**, select **"Search Tool"**. Run a search with the search term **Seattle**.
3. Select a dataset such as **Daily Summaries (GHCND)**.
4. Choose a **date range** (for example, the past 10 years) and download the data as a **.csv file** (I've donwloaded a file for you on CANVAS)
5. Once you get to the map view, find a station and click the **View Full Details** link.

**Pay special attention to 'data coverage' - this lets you know how much missing data there is in the time period**

:::

::: promptbox
### Step 2: Read the Documentation {-}
Before analyzing the data, read the **GHCND (Global Historical Climatology Network – Daily)** documentation:

[GHCND Documentation (NOAA)](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/pub/data/ghcn/daily/readme.txt)

This file describes:

- The meaning of each column 
- Units
- Flags that indicate data quality or measurement conditions

**What units are precipitation and temperature in?**

### Step 3: Raw data exploration - Daily{-}

Save the sea_tac.R file to your **Models** folder

Be sure the place the dataset seatac_data.csv in a folder titled **data** (which should be inside your Models folder) 

In the **Daily Time Series Tab**

- Any outliers? are they real? or are they errors?
- Do the values make sense?
- Observe any trends
- Zoom in on a period of 5 years, what do you notice about daily rainfall?

:::

::: promptbox
### Step 4: Raw data exploration - Annual {-}

Hit the **Update Annual** button

- What do you notice about the means?
- Would you say rainfall is stationary?

Now hit the **Update Distribution** button

- Toggle on the **Exclude zero-rain days** (hit update)
  - Why do you this we exclude the zeros?
  - What kind of distribution is this?
  - Comment on the tail of this distribution
  
- Toggle on the **Overlay Period B** button
  - Make period B run from 2015 to present
  - Discuss what you observe

:::


::: promptbox
### Step 5: Raw data exploration - Monthly {-}

Repeat what you did for the Annual but not in the **Monthly Tab**

- Which months are interesting in terms of how they are changing
- Describe their change in terms of the distribution shifts

:::

::: promptbox
### Step 6: Conceptual Modelling of Rainfall {-}

Go back to the Daily Time Series Tab
Set the dates from 2024-10-15 to 2025-10-15

- In a small group, think about how you would create an synthetic timeseries of rainfall.
- How could you use the dataset we downloaded?
- What statistics could we utilize?
- Any ideas on how we could use probabilities to build a timeseries?
